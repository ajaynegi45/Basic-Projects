# ATM Management System ✨
Hello there 👋🏻, and welcome to my ATM Management! 

My name is Ajay Negi, and I'm thrilled to share my creative work and professional experiences with you.
<br><br>

### Overview  👀

The ATM project is a simple Java application that simulates an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It provides a **command-line interface** to perform basic banking operations, such as checking account balance, depositing funds, withdrawing money, and viewing Account Details.
<br>

### Features 
- The program prompts the user to enter a customer ID and PIN for authentication.
- Default customer **ID** 9958 and customer **PIN** 3345
- It validates the customer ID and PIN and allows the user to access the account if the credentials are correct.
- Users can select the account type (Savings or Current).
- After selecting the account type, users can perform various operations such as checking account details, viewing balance, withdrawing funds, depositing funds, and exiting the ATM.


### How to Run 🏃🏻‍♂️
To run the ATM Management project, follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the  `Learn java/Projects/ATM Management`  folder.
3. Compile the  `ATM.java`  file using the following command:
   <br>
   <br>
   ```
   javac ATM.java
   ```
5. Run the compiled program with:
   <br>
   <br>
   ```
   java ATM
   ```

‼️ **Note**: Both projects are written in Java and can be executed in any Java-supported environment. Make sure to have the latest version of Java installed on your system to run the programs successfully.
