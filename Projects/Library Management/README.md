# Library Management ‚ú®

Hello there üëãüèª, and welcome to my Library Management! 

My name is Ajay Negi, and I'm thrilled to share my creative work and professional experiences with you.

### Overview  üëÄ

The Library Management project is a Java application designed to manage a library's book inventory and borrowing system. It provides a user-friendly command-line interface for librarians and users to perform various operations. Some of the key features of this project include adding and removing books from the library, checking book availability, borrowing and returning books.

### Features
- The program presents a menu of options to the librarian for managing the library.
- The librarian can add books to the library, and the program ensures that duplicate books are not added.
- The librarian can issue books to readers if the book is available in the library.
- The librarian can also return books to the library, updating the availability status accordingly.
- The program provides options to view the available books, issued books, and a history of all books added to the library.



### How to Run
To run the Library Management project, follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the  `Learn java/Projects/Library Management`  folder.
3. Compile the  `Library.java`  file using the following command:
   <br>
   <br>
   ```
   javac Library.java
   ```
5. Run the compiled program with:
   <br><br>
   ```
   java Library
   ```


‚ÄºÔ∏è **Note**: Both projects are written in Java and can be executed in any Java-supported environment. Make sure to have the latest version of Java installed on your system to run the programs successfully.
