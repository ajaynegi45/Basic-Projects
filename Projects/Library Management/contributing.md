## How to contribute 👀

Contributions are always welcome!

We're grateful for any contributions you can make to the project. Here are some ways you can get involved:

- **🐞 Report a Bug**: If you notice a bug in the Library Management, please let us know by creating an issue in the project's issue tracker. We would appreciate it if you could describe the problem in detail, so we can understand it and fix it as soon as possible. If you are able to fix the bug yourself, you can submit a pull request with the fix.

- **🎉 New Features**: If you have an idea for a new feature that you would like to see in the Library Management, we'd love to hear about it. Please create an issue in the project's issue tracker to discuss your idea, and we'll work with you to see if it's a good fit for the project. You can also submit a pull request with the new feature implementation.

- **💻 Improve User Interface**: If you have a knack for design and user experience, you can contribute by improving the user interface of the Library Management. You can suggest changes to the layout, color scheme, or fonts used in the Library Management. Please make sure that any changes you propose are easy to understand by the user and follow a clean and minimal approach.
